**Wordpress** is awesome when it comes to extending its capabilities. One can easily extend wordpress capabilities by adding new functionality as plugins. The advantage of adding new functionality as plugins is in sync with the wordpress notion of breaking things into modules which helps in code maintenance. Secondly when doing theme changes the developer has not to worry because theme changes won't effect the plugin. Wordpress has a huge collection of plugins build by developers around the world. Most of the plugins
are availabe on [Wordpress.org](https://www.wordpress.org/plugins) website. In this case i have also developed a simple plugin which is actually based on the Matt Mullenweg's Hello dolly plugin. The plugin shows a quote at the top right corner of every admin page. The quotes are written by the great mystic sufi poet namely **Rumi**. The plugin is available [here](//www.wordpress.org/plugins/hello-rumi).You can  install it in your wordpress sites and enjoy the spiritual essence of the quotes while developing.
