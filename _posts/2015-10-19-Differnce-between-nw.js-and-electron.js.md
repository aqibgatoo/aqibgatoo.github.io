There are two ways to develop cross platform desktop applications one is [Electron.js](http://electron.atom.io/) by [github](http://www.github.com) and other [NW.js](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/
) formerly known as node-webkit.It is quite confusing to know which to use in our own applications but thanks to electron team they have clearly pointed out the differences between the two platforms in this nicely written [article](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/development/atom-shell-vs-node-webkit.md) which compares the two platforms.
