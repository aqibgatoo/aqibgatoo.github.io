comments: true

 "We never thought a video would be
  watched in numbers greater than a
  32-bit integer (=2,147,483,647 views), but
  that was before we met PSY. 'Gangnam Style'
  has been viewed so many times we have to
  upgrade!"
 These words are not mine but the youtube google plus [post](https://plus.google.com/+youtube/posts/BUXfdWqu86Q)
 which mentions that gangnam style had got actually more views than the actual number of views shown.
 
 > The problem was that google was using
  a 32-bit integer to represent the number
  of video view counter.The number of views
  that gangnam style were actually more
  than the range of 32-bit integer. So to
  correct the thing, the people at youtube have now shifted to using a 64-bit integer
  that has an astonishing limit of 9,223,372,036,854,775,808.
